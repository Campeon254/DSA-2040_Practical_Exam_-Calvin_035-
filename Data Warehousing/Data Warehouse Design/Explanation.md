## STAR SCHEMA vs SNOWFLAKE SCHEMA
I chose a star schema because of its simplicity and ease of use. The star schema has a straightforward design, which makes it easier for users to understand and query the data. In a star schema, the fact table is at the center, surrounded by dimension tables that are directly connected to it. This design allows for quick access to data and efficient querying.

The following is a visual representation of the star schema:
