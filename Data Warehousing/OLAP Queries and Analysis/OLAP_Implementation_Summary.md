# OLAP Queries Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. OLAP SQL Queries Created
We have successfully created three OLAP-style SQL queries in `OLAP_Queries.sql`:

#### a) Roll-up Query: Total sales by country and quarter
```sql
SELECT
    c.Country,
    t.Quarter,
    t.Year,
    SUM(fs.SalesAmount) AS TotalSales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fs.CustomerID) AS UniqueCustomers,
    COUNT(*) AS TransactionCount
FROM FactSales_TB fs
JOIN Customer_TB c ON fs.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN Time_TB t ON fs.TimeID = t.TimeID
GROUP BY c.Country, t.Quarter, t.Year
ORDER BY t.Year, t.Quarter, TotalSales DESC;
```

#### b) Drill-down Query: Sales details for United Kingdom by month
```sql
SELECT
    t.Year,
    t.Month,
    CASE t.Month
        WHEN 1 THEN 'January'
        -- ... (all months mapped)
        WHEN 12 THEN 'December'
    END AS MonthName,
    SUM(fs.SalesAmount) AS MonthlySales,
    AVG(fs.SalesAmount) AS AvgTransactionValue,
    COUNT(*) AS TransactionCount
FROM FactSales_TB fs
JOIN Time_TB t ON fs.TimeID = t.TimeID
JOIN Customer_TB c ON fs.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
WHERE c.Country = 'United Kingdom'
GROUP BY t.Year, t.Month
ORDER BY t.Year, t.Month;
```

#### c) Slice Query: Total sales for specific product categories
```sql
SELECT
    p.ProductCategory,
    SUM(fs.SalesAmount) AS TotalSales,
    SUM(fs.QuantitySold) AS TotalQuantity,
    COUNT(DISTINCT p.ProductID) AS ProductCount,
    AVG(fs.SalesAmount) AS AvgSalesPerTransaction
FROM FactSales_TB fs
JOIN Product_TB p ON fs.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE p.ProductCategory IN ('Home Decor', 'Vintage', 'Sets')
GROUP BY p.ProductCategory
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
```

### 2. Database Schema Created
- Created DWHS.db database with proper star schema
- Implemented dimension tables: Customer_TB, Product_TB, Time_TB, Store_TB
- Implemented fact table: FactSales_TB with foreign key relationships
- Successfully imported and transformed data from retail_dw.db

### 3. Python Execution Scripts Created
- `execute_olap_queries.py`: Comprehensive OLAP analysis with visualizations
- `simple_olap.py`: Focused script for the three required queries
- `test_db.py`: Database connectivity testing script

### 4. Visualization Scripts
Each script includes matplotlib visualizations that generate:
- Bar charts for country sales comparison
- Line plots for temporal trends
- Multi-panel charts for category analysis
- Heatmaps for cross-dimensional analysis

### 5. Analysis Report
Created comprehensive `OLAP_Analysis_Report.md` with:
- Executive summary of findings
- Detailed analysis of each OLAP operation
- Business insights and recommendations
- Technical implementation notes

## Files Created
1. `OLAP_Queries.sql` - SQL queries for the three OLAP operations
2. `execute_olap_queries.py` - Full OLAP analysis script
3. `simple_olap.py` - Simplified execution script
4. `test_db.py` - Database testing script
5. `OLAP_Analysis_Report.md` - Comprehensive analysis report
6. `OLAP_Implementation_Summary.md` - This summary document

## Expected Outputs
When the Python scripts are executed, they will generate:
1. **Console Output**: Query results displayed in tabular format
2. **Visualizations**: PNG files with charts and graphs
3. **Analysis**: Insights into sales patterns, trends, and performance

## Key Insights Expected
1. **Roll-up Analysis**: Geographic and temporal sales patterns
2. **Drill-down Analysis**: Detailed UK market performance by month
3. **Slice Analysis**: Product category performance comparison

## Next Steps
To execute the OLAP queries:
1. Ensure DWHS.db database exists (created via Data Warehouse Design/Queries.py)
2. Run `python simple_olap.py` for basic analysis
3. Run `python execute_olap_queries.py` for comprehensive analysis
4. Review generated PNG visualization files
5. Analyze results as documented in OLAP_Analysis_Report.md

## Data Warehouse Benefits Demonstrated
- **Aggregation Speed**: Fast roll-up operations across dimensions
- **Drill-down Capability**: Seamless transition from summary to detail
- **Slice Operations**: Focused analysis on specific dimension values
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Cross-tabulation of different business dimensions
- **Decision Support**: Clear insights for strategic and operational decisions
